# Bott
This is a discord bot that utilizes Google's Rest API for Calendar, Drive, and Sheets. 
1. The bot first takes the sheet from the schedule manager in .XLSM in google spreadsheets and save it to the drive as .XLS format
2. The bot then takes the spreadsheet and create sub-calendars for the new workers/ delete calendars which has no new events updated. 
3. The bot finally takes the spreadsheet data to create events according to The Alley's work schedule format, and output it into the discord chat as publicaly available calendar.  

Ther are some additional functions created out of boredom. Feel free to contact me for any questions I can answer!
